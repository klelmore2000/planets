Mars is a little smaller than Earth, but red.
Mars does, however, have two moons, which might be problematic for Wolfman.
It's also pretty cold on Mars, not to mention the low pressure.
Mars is the fourth planet form the sun with no water.
Well, no liquid water, anyway.
There's lots of iron there, too, but not elemental.
